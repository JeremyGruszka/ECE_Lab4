#### ALU Sim analysis

In order to make sure that my program worked, I went through and made sure the result was correct for each of the 8 functions.  The top row of boxes is the function.  The second row of boxes is the Data input.  The third row of boxes is the Accumulator input.  The final row of boxes is the Result output.  Function "000" is AND.  The inputs were correctly anded together for that function.  Function "001" is NEG. The inputs were correctly put into 2's complement for that function. Function "010" is NOT.  The inputs were correctly notted for that function.  Function "011" is ROR.  The inputs were correctly rotated right one space for that function.  Function "100" is OR.  The inputs were correctly ored together for that function.  Function "101" is IN.  The input was correctly stored into the result for that function.  Function "110" is ADD.  The inputs were correctly added together for this function.  Function "111" is LD.  All inputs were correctly loaded into the result for this function.  After determining that my simulation was correct, it was determined that my program was correct.

#### ALU Sim debugging
The only real problem I had with the ALU sim portion of the lab was the ROR function.  I could not figure out how to rotate right for the life of me.  So I googled bit rotation and found out there was a built in rotate_right function in the program that I could use.  After that, my program was good.

#### Datapath Debugging
Was able to do this part of the lab fairly easily.  The biggest problem was that the first time I ran through the simulation, my AeqZero and AlessZero were 'U" instead of '1' or '0'.  I found out that the problem was in the instantiation of my ALU in the datapath program.  I had it hooked up to the incorrect wires.  Once I fixed the wiring, my simulation worked correctly, showing that the program I wrote was correct.  I confirmed that my simulation was correct by comparing it piece by piece to the picture provided in the lab.
